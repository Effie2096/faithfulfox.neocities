	<p>Hi! I'm Faith. My friends call me effie ❤️</p>
	<p class="accent">programming; art; music; anime; food; retro s<span class="censor">hit</span>; gaming; foxes :P</p>
	<p>I've been having so much fun making this site :D I hope to write about my interests on here and hear from others
		who share the same passions.</p>
</div>
<div class="content-body">
	<p>My main interest is software development. Although I'm not as good at it as I'd like I have fun and find things
		like this to keep me motivated.</p>
	<p>I love retro gaming and emulation. The games I've spent the most time playing in the last few years are
		emulated and/or older than me lol. I love rogue-likes; my favourite recently is CDDA. I also like strategy games
		like Civilization, 4X games, and RTS.</p>
	<p>I enjoy cooking and preparing food when I have time and the motivation. I love to bake and making food for others.
	</p>
	<p>I've been trying to get more into anime and manga as of late. I struggle to watch shows and read because of my
		attention span but I've
		watched/read a few recommended by friends and I'm enjoying it. </p>
	<p>I'm a hobbyist music producer and musician. Maybe I'll make something worth sharing here at some point. I really
		love old synths, eurorack modular and live coding music.</p>
	<span class="censor">also, I use vim and Arch btw :3</span>
