		I needed some little art things for the site and I thought it'd be fun to

		money I wasn't willing to spend rn lmao).
	</p>
	<p>
		I made a little post-it note for the to-do list and sprites for the fox to
		chase the cursor &gt;&lt;. Again, I'm not much of a designer, pixel artist
		or w/e but I did my best and had fun and thought I'd share. ‚ù§Ô∏è I'll probably
		expand on the fox spritesheet in the future to include little jumps and
		stuff but maybe you could too? :D x
	</p>
	<p>
		The scale on the fox is a bit all over the place haha but it's close enough
		I left it. Feel free to download the fox sprite sheet or the post it note
		and use them for cool s<span class="censor">hit</span>. Sprite sheet below
		and just rightclick and save the post-it note if you want it.

	<h3>Animation~</h3>
	<p>
		Aseprite/Libresprite has animation features that I hadn't used yet but I
		thought it'd be cool to use it to make the fox jumping animation I wanted to
		do. I wasn't really sure how I should incorportate that into the fox that
		follows the cursor and it occurred to me I don't have a site button yet! So,
		I decided I'd make an animated Fox Den Button&trade; &gt;&lt;.
	</p>
	<p>
		For the cursor, I didn't really use much in the way of references or like
		even using the previous sprites as starting points (hence why the scale is
		pretty s<span class="censor">hit</span> in places lmao). The animation
		timeline thing has onion skinning, a feature that shows previous and/or
		following frames to the one you're working on at a lower opacity. This made
		it really easy to draw following frames :D.
	</p>

	<div class="media-card">
		<div class="media-card-title">
			<h4>Animation Onionskinning</h4>
		</div>
		<img
			src="/assets/img/fox_pet/libresprite_onionskin.png"
			alt="Fox animation onion skin."
		/>
	</div>
	<div class="media-side">
		<img class="media" src="/assets/img/FoxDenLogo.gif" alt="Fox Den Button" />
		<p>
			But anywho, that was fun also and I'm happy with the result and it's the
			same foxy guy so I just put it here. This was my first time making an
			animation and I definitely want to do more. I also hope you can be
			inspired to draw or animate something of your own ^^.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you want to link to my site, click the Fox Den Logo in the right
			sidebar :3 It'll download the logo and copy the html you need to paste in
			your site &gt;&lt; (just make sure you move the image/adjust the path in
			the html to your needs).
		</p>
		<p>
			I guess as a side note, being new to this, I did the animation horribly
			inefficiently. For anyone who maybe wants to try this sort of thing, I'd
			recommend roughly drawing out the major keyframes in just line art before
			anything else; I was completing each fox frame in it's entirety as I went
			which meant if I made a mistake, I put a lot of work into something that
			a) now had to be changed or discarded and b) due to the nature of this,
			had a cascading affect on the following frames of the animation. So I had
			like two instances where I had to move a bunch of frames to fix something
			small. Get the flow, positioning and pace of the most significant points
			of the animation right before moving on to doing all the frames, their
			detail, color and perfecting form (using the word "perfect"
			<strong>very</strong> loosely here lmao but you know what I mean).

	<h3>Content Warnings~</h3>
	<p>
		I decided to add content warning things to the shrines page and, again
		figured it would be way more fun and cool if I made my own dinky little art
		for it üòé. I forgot to post these when I made them; I sort of wasn't done
		with them and was trying to think what other ones I should make but never
		really came up with any. I'll just make more as and when they're needed ^^.
		Anyway, I thought this was a really cool idea and as always feel free to
		"steal" them or make your own <i>bwah~</i>.
