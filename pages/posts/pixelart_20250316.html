		I've not done much drawing in years but I tried my hand at a few pixel art things lately and it

		I needed some little art things for the site and I thought it'd be fun to make them on my own
		(plus all the ones I
		found online that I liked cost money I wasn't willing to spend rn lmao).
	</p>
	<p>
		I made a little post-it note for the to-do list and sprites for the fox to chase the cursor
		&gt;&lt;. Again, I'm not much of a designer, pixel artist or w/e but I did my best and had fun
		and thought I'd share. ❤️ I'll probably expand on the fox spritesheet in the future to include
		little jumps and stuff but maybe you could too? :D x

		The scale on the fox is a bit all over the place haha but it's close enough I left it. Feel free
		to download the fox sprite sheet or the post it note and use them for cool s<span

		Here's the <strong>Aseprite</strong> project file in case you own that. There's also a free

		anything you want and have a good day mwah!

	<h3>Animation~</h3>
	<p>
		Aseprite/Libresprite has animation features that I hadn't used yet but I thought it'd be cool to
		use it to make the fox jumping animation I wanted to do. I wasn't really sure how I should
		incorportate that into the fox that follows the cursor and it occurred to me I don't have a site
		button yet! So, I decided I'd make an animated Fox Den
		Button&trade; &gt;&lt;.
	</p>
	<p>
		For the cursor, I didn't really use much in the way of references or like even using the
		previous sprites as starting points (hence why the scale is pretty s<span
			class="censor">hit</span> in places lmao). The animation timeline thing has onion skinning, a
		feature that shows previous and/or following frames to the one you're working on at a lower
		opacity. This made it really easy to draw following frames :D.

			But anywho, that was fun also and I'm happy with the result and it's the same foxy guy so I
			just put it here. This was my first time making an animation and I definitely want to do more.
			I also hope you can be inspired to draw or animate something of your own ^^.
		</p>
		<p>
			I guess as a side note, being new to this, I did the animation horribly inefficiently. For
			anyone who maybe wants to try this sort of thing, I'd recommend roughly drawing out the major
			keyframes in just line art before anything else; I was completing each fox frame in it's
			entirety as I went which meant if I made a mistake, I put a lot of work into something that a)
			now had to be changed or discarded and b) due to the nature of this, had a cascading affect on
			the following frames of the animation. So I had like two instances where I had to move a bunch
			of frames to fix something small. Get the flow, positioning and pace of the most significant
			points of the animation right before moving on to doing all the frames, their detail, color
			and perfecting form (using the word "perfect" <strong>very</strong> loosely here lmao but you
			know what I mean).
