		I showed my ebic friend <strong>Moi</strong> my website and they showed it
		to their gf <strong>Shyni~</strong>. She really liked it and I suggested
		they make ones too (of course I did &gt;&lt;) and she was really excited by
		the idea. I always love her enthusiasm and energy so when she said she
		wanted to but needed taught how, I had to agree :D.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Shyni</strong> is amazing, mega smart and was picking up everything
		I taught her super fast despite not having done much coding and stuff at all
		before. I'm so proud of her. Most people get intimidated and don't try so it
		was refeshing that she just dove in and tried (there were a few funny
		misunderstands along the way because of a language barrier but we got
		through it!).

		I don't know if I'm really the best at teaching haha but I did my best and
		I'd like to be able to teach more in the future ^^

		Erm we also kinda got distracted along the way lol. I showed her the

		&nbsp;site I've used to make the pfp in my about me section and we ended up
		spending like half an hour just making some random starter pack things
		bahaha.
