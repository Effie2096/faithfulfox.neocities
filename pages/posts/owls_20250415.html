		The owls are like therapy owls. They go around to care homes and such to
		show off and help people. They were joking they (the owls) were banned from
		elderly homes though because one of them likes shiney things and kept f<span

		around with mobility scooter controls lmao.

	<p>
		The people that brought them in were telling us a bunch of owl facts while
		showing off three of their owls (they have more). The white one was so
		pretty and sat in the corner with their mouth open the whole time lmao.
		Their names were Gizmo, Bob and Ziggy.

			We got a chance to hold Ziggy which was really cool. We had to wear a
			protective glove and got them to perch on our arm with it. They gave us a
			card with the owl on it if we held them.
