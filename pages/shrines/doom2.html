					I never played DOOM or DOOM II back when they came out (they came out before I was born
					&gt;&lt;) or when growing up for that matter. My first experience playing them for the
					first time was when my ebic friend <strong> Annie</strong> just randomly decided we were
					going to play it one time. She helped me get a couple mods and showed me how to run it all
					using the Zandronum source port (I didn't know what the <i>f<span
							class="censor">uck</span></i> that was at the time either lol) so we could play it
					together. We used doomseeker iirc to play with each other and she hosted 'cause my
					internet was (is) <i>a<span class="censor">ss</span></i>.
				</p>
				<p>
					All I remember was we had a cool hub world with npcs; We played some weird map where we
					walked into a fleshy walled cavern that stuck with me and then we tried some wave defense
					mode for a bit that we didn't last very long in lol.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the other mods she had me download was <strong>Brutal Doom</strong> (ye, sounds
					ebic), which I think we used in multiplayer (I still have a preset called "BrutalDoomSP"
					for it in the launcher I use.. I feel like past me wouldn't have felt the need to specify
					Single Player in the name if we <i>hadn't</i> used it in multiplayer.. but then again I am
					a bit of a tupid <i>b<span class="censor">itch</span></i>). This mod changes the gunplay
					and adds sick, OTT blood effects, bullet projectiles, different animations and behaviour
					for enemies.. it changes the game a lot despite not really adding much in the way of
					content. It just makes the game feel way more like a modern FPS in such a satisfying way
					that I think I can single handedly attribute my DOOM II modding addiction to this one mod.
				</p>
				<div style="background-color: rgb(168, 4, 18); color: black; padding: 5px;">
					<p>
						Quick aside: I <i>think</i> there was some controversy about <strong>Brutal
							Doom</strong> or rather the mod author being an <i>a<span
								class="censor">ss</span>hole</i> and/or stealing from other mods? (do your own
						research). Not gonna dwell on it here but some people let that sort of stuff influence
						them so I thought I'd mention it. I personally don't care about that sort of stuff with
						anything and don't let artists' personalities or actions influence my enjoyment of their
						creatons if I can help it so ye I don't wanna hear it lmao.
					</p>
					<p>
						smol aside aside: there's also just some DOOM purists who hate anything that changes the
						core gameplay too much.. going as far as malding if you so much as have weapon reloading
						in your game lmao.. ye I don't need to say much else on that.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p />
				<p>Back to our scheduled reminiscing.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Annie</strong> was very busy around about the time she introduced me to the game
					so we only played it once and in hindsight I really don't know why she decided we were
					going to play DOOM because she's literally never played it again since I think and lowkey
					bullies me on occasion to this day for playing it lmao.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fast forward a couple years now I guess and I unironically think DOOM II is the game I've
					sank the most time into over the last like two years at the time of writing this.. so I
					guess you could say I like the game. Again, the vanilla expericence is a bit dry and dated
					on it's own tbh (although there's some novelty to playing it with just keyboard for a
					little bit) but some of the mods for it, especially total conversions really help the core
					gameplay flourish (wtf am I even saying at this point?).

						<p>So.. I guess I'll start with <strong>Brutal Doom</strong> :D</p>
						<p>
							This is by no means my favourite DOOM II mod but I gassed it up enough in the Origins
							section and it was the first DOOM II mod I knew by name so I'll start there (also it's
							just fun and kinda a precursor to some of my favourite mods in a way).

							<strong>Brutal Doom's</strong> main features are the gunplay, ai and excessive gore!
							Guns
							have recoil now as well as actual projectiles. A lot of the weapons also have ADS (aim
							down sights) now, and the ones that don't have an alternate fire mode. These do a lot
							to
							make the gunplay more satisfying and modern feeling I feel. There's also just a lot of
							new
							guns added and they've all been rebalanced to stay relevant throughout the game so
							there's
							more reason to swap weapons often.

							My favourite weapon is the new double-barrel shotgun (it turns demons into soup :3).

							the epitome of everything good about this mod; the sound is <strong>huuge</strong> and
							impactful and it leaves a pile of entrails and gibs where the feeble demon before you
							used
							to stand :D.
						</p>

						<p>
							The enemies are "smarter" now and have more interesting behaviour and animations. You
							can
							also perform headshots on enemies now for more damage and they can be dismembered,
							sawn
							in
							half and more! Come on down to the Gib-porium for all your Gibbing needs.
						</p>

						</div>

						<p>
							As you can probably tell, the blood and gore has been raised to a spectacular level in
							this mod. The amount of blood is immediately noticable but beyond that there's also
							quite
							impressive blood splatters, gibs and sprite interactions; blood, guts and limbs can be
							seen dripping from the ceiling and running down walls when you decimate enemies.
							Enemies
							can also still be interacted with after death so corpses caught in the crossfire will
							be
							damaged further. Beyond this, there's also some gruesome death animations like some
							zombies dropping to the floor and still fighting back.

							As the name suggests, Brutal Doom: Black Edition is based on Brutal Doom with the aim
							of
							being more dark and serious. It still retains some fast paced and over the top aspects
							of Brutal Doom that are inspired by the newer Doom games, but more emphasis was placed
							on maintaining original Doom's "evil and creepy atmosphere" as the author puts it.
						</p>
						<p>
							And that's it; it modernizes DOOM II a bit like regular Brutal Doom but just has a
							really cool, darker atmosphere to it akin to what they were going for in Doom 3.

						<div style="background-color: rgb(168, 4, 18); color: black; padding: 5px;">
							<p>
								Unpopular opinion alert but I really liked Doom 3 because of the atmosphere but
								probably along with everyone else I got bored of the game cause the gunplay kinda
								sucked and there's not really enough of a draw from the narritive and story to drive
								a
								survival horror vibe which I think felt more like what they were going for with that
								one. I like that Black Edition kinda gets that darker visual atmosphere but just
								sticks to being a satisfying shooter still.

						<p>
							As you can see in the gameplay, it is quite literally darker. It has several options
							for
							making the lighting dark and Black Edition comes with a flashlight for this reason. I
							didn't have the sector lighting settings enabled though for the recording however I
							was
							also using D64ified and this makes the game noticibly darker for one reason or another
							and I think it works well with Black Edition. The Doom64 textures are also widely
							regarded as the better, grittier versions. There's also nice bloom and light effects
							that aren't from just GZDoom and I'm not sure if that's from the HD texture pack or
							the
							fog effects mod. Therein lies the issue with using a load of mods with any game I
							suppose; I'm not 100% sure of all the nuances of each mod lmao.
