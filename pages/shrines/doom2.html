				<p>I never played DOOM or DOOM II back when they came out (they came out before I was born ><) or when growing
						up for that matter. My first experience playing them for the first time was when my ebic friend <strong>
						Annie</strong>
						just randomly decided we were going to play it one time. She helped me get a couple mods and showed me how
						to
						run it all using the Zandronum source port (I didn't know what the <i>f<span>uck</span></i> that was at the
						time either
						lol) so we
						could play it together. We used doomseeker iirc to play with each other and she hosted 'cause my internet
						was
						(is)
						<i>a<span>ss</span></i>.</p>
				<p>All I remember was we had a cool hub world with npcs; We played some weird map where we walked into a fleshy
					walled cavern that stuck with me and then we tried some wave defense mode for a bit that we didn't last very
					long in lol.</p>
				<p>One of the other mods she had me download was
					<strong>Brutal Doom</strong> (ye, sounds ebic), which I think we used in multiplayer (I still have a preset
					called "BrutalDoomSP" for it
					in the launcher I use.. I feel like past me wouldn't have felt the need to specify Single
					Player in the name if we <i>hadn't</i> used it in multiplayer.. but then again I am a bit of a tupid
					<i>b<span>itch</span></i>). This mod changes the gunplay and adds sick, OTT blood effects,
					bullet projectiles, different animations and behaviour for enemies.. it changes the game a lot despite not
					really adding much in the way of content. It just makes the game feel way more like a modern FPS in such a
					satisfying way that I think I can single handedly attribute my DOOM II modding addiction to this one mod.
				</p>
				<div style="background-color: rgb(168, 4, 18); color: black; padding: 5px;">
					<p>Quick aside: I <i>think</i> there was some controversy about <strong>Brutal Doom</strong> or rather the mod
						author being an <i>a<span>ss</span>hole</i> and/or stealing from other mods? (do your own research). Not
						gonna
						dwell on it
						here but some people let that sort of stuff influence them so I thought I'd mention it. I personally don't
						care about that sort of stuff with anything and don't let artists' personalities or actions influence my
						enjoyment of their creatons if I can help it so ye I don't wanna hear it lmao. </p>
					<p>smol aside aside: there's also just some DOOM purists who hate anything that changes the core gameplay too
						much.. going as far as malding if you so much as have weapon reloading in your game lmao.. ye I don't need
						to
						say much else on that.</p>
				</div>
				<p />
				<p>Back to our scheduled reminiscing.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Annie</strong> was very busy around about the time she introduced me to the game so we only played it
					once and in hindsight I really don't know why she decided we were going to play DOOM because she's literally
					never played it again since I think and lowkey bullies me on occasion to this day for playing it lmao.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fast forward a couple years now I guess and I unironically think DOOM II is the game I've sank the most time
					into over the last like two years at the time of writing this.. so I guess you could say I like the game.
					Again, the vanilla expericence is a bit dry and dated on it's own tbh (although there's some novelty to
					playing it with just keyboard for a little bit) but some of the mods for it, especially total conversions
					really help the core gameplay flourish (wtf am I even saying at this point?).

				</div>
				<p>So.. I guess I'll start with <strong>Brutal Doom</strong> :D</p>
				<p>
					This is by no means my favourite DOOM II mod but I gassed it up enough in the Origins section and it was the
					first DOOM II mod I knew by name so I'll start there (also it's just fun and kinda a precursor to some of my
					favourite mods in a way).

					</video>
					<span><i>sorry if you don't like blood hehe</i></span>
				</div>

				<p>
					<strong>Brutal Doom's</strong> main features are the gunplay, ai and excessive gore! Guns have recoil now as
					well
					as actual projectiles. A lot of the weapons also have ADS (aim down sights) now, and the ones that don't have
					an alternate fire mode. These do a lot to make the gunplay more satisfying and modern feeling I feel.
					There's also just a lot of new guns added and they've all been rebalanced to stay relevant throughout the
					game so there's more reason to swap weapons often.

					<span><i>the boomstick</i></span>
				</div>

				<p>
					My favourite weapon is the new double-barrel shotgun (it turns demons into soup :3). It's the epitome of
					everything good about this mod; the sound is <strong>huuge</strong> and impactful and it leaves a pile of
					entrails and gibs where the feeble demon before you used to stand :D.
				</p>

				<p>
					The enemies are "smarter" now and have more interesting behaviour and animations. You can also perform
					headshots on enemies now for more damage and they can be dismembered, sawn in half and more!
					Come on down to the Gib-porium for all your Gibbing needs.
				</p>
				<p style="text-align: center;"> ...ye sorry.</p>

				<p>
					But on that note. <strong>THE GORE!</strong>
				</p>

						<h3>ooo~ aaaah~ so Brutal</h3>

					<span><i>over the top gore</i></span>
				</div>

				<p>
					As you can probably tell, the blood and gore has been raised to a spectacular level in this mod. The amount of
					blood is immediately noticable but beyond that there's also quite impressive blood splatters, gibs and sprite
					interactions; blood, guts and limbs can be seen dripping from the ceiling and running down walls when you
					decimate enemies. Enemies can also still be interacted with after death so corpses caught in the crossfire
					will be damaged further. Beyond this, there's also some gruesome death animations like some zombies dropping
					to the floor and still fighting back.
				</p>

					It's worth mentioning I rarely (never) play with just a single mod, even with huge total conversions I tend to
					try my luck seeing what other small things I can get away with. In the gifs, the following recommneded mods
